=head1 NAME

SpaceTrack - Perl application to fetch satellite orbit data.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This application provides a command-line interface to the
Astro::SpaceTrack module, based on the Astro::SpaceTrack::shell
subroutine.

This gives you interactive access to all Astro::SpaceTrack methods,
plus pseudo output redirection (with tilde expansion) if you want your
output to go to a file.

Please see L<Astro::SpaceTrack> for the details.
