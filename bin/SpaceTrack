#	Remarks:
#		This Perl script is just a really simple encapsulation
#		of the Astro::SpaceTrack shell subroutine. Note that the
#		command line arguments are passed, so you can do things
#		like
#		$ perl SpaceTrack 'set username me password secret'
#		followed by whatever commands you like at the SpaceTrack
#		prompt.
