Astro::SpaceTrack version 0.007

This library logs in to the Space Track web site and downloads orbital
elements. It does nothing that you can't do with a web browser, but it
does give you a way to automate things.

Note that you are required to register for a username and password before
making use of the Space Track web site.

FEDERAL LAW FORBIDS THE REDISTRIBUTION OF DOWNLOADED ORBITAL ELEMENTS
TO THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT PRIOR PERMISSION.

At some point along its career, this module has been seen to work under
the following operating systems (or, more correctly, values of $^O):
cygwin, darwin, MacOS, MSWin32, and VMS.

This module is installable by the usual incantation:

    gunzip Astro-SpaceTrack-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Astro-SpaceTrack-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS.

Note that once you have done the "make" step you can play with either of
the two specimen applications provided (SpaceTrack.pl for a command-line
version, or SpaceTrackTk.pl for the Perl/Tk windowed version). If you want
to do this before installing, you need to invoke them as (e.g.)
    $ perl -Mblib SpaceTrack.pl
Under VMS, you'll need to quote the -M thus:
    $ perl "-Mblib" SpaceTrack.pl

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
SpaceTrack.pm and the SpaceTrack folder into the Astro directory
(creating it if necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
