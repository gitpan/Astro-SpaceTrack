The tools/ directory contains tools used to manage the Astro-SpaceTrack
distribution. Its contents are:

README - This file.

capture - A script to execute Space Track queries, censor the results
	heavily, and write the results to the directory and file that
	Mock::LWP::UserAgent (in the inc/ directory of this
	distribution) will read them from. Because the names of the
	files are completely cryptic, it will also list the files with
	their contents. Use tools/capture --help for the documentation.
