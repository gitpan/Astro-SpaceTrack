0.031 21-Dec-2007 T. R. Wyant
    Fix embedded modifier bug, exposed by the fixing of the
	corresponding Perl bug (id=22354) in 5.10.0 -- or 5.9.0
	actually. Thanks to Andy Lester's article:
	http://perlbuzz.com/mechanix/2007/12/code-broken-by-regex-fixes-in.html
	which tipped me off before I had to discover the problem
	for myself.
    Fixed dependencies in Makefile.PL and Build.PL.
    Went back to prompting for executables in Makefile.PL and
	Build.PL, as a way to handle apparant ActiveState build
	failure because both they and I were running pl2bat.bat.
    Enhance ExtUtils::MakeMaker version detection in Makefile.PL,
	since ActiveState is apparantly deploying a Perl 5.10
	with a development version of that module.

0.032 06-Jul-2008 T. R. Wyant
    More graceful failure when unable to parse Space Track data.

0.033 30-Sep-2008 T. R. Wyant
    Fix Build.PL -y (and -n)
    Add iridium_status('sladen') to scrape Rod Sladen's Iridium
	Constallation Status web page.
    Add attribute 'url_iridium_status_sladen'.

0.034 24-Nov-2008 T. R. Wyant
    Eliminate use of UNIVERSAL::isa as a function.
    Add 'Pragma spacetrack-source = ' header to all methods
	that return TLEs or Iridium status, saying where
	the data came from.
    Add content_source() method to access spacetrack-source
	header.
    Try for less bad test coverage. Good coverage awaits a
	rewrite of the shell() method.

0.035 23-Dec-2008 T. R. Wyant
    When using Rod Sladen's data for Iridium status, mark all
	'failed' iridiums as tumbling, whether or not there is
	a 't' next to their numbers. This makes the Sladen data
	consistent with Mike McCants' (as of 22-Dec-2008) and
	T. S. Kelso's.
    Bring all code up to perlcritic --stern (sometimes by
	declaring exceptions)
    Restructure Build.PL and Makefile.PL to better accomodate
	the installed version of Module::Build or
	ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
    Add minimum Perl version to 'requires' key in Build.PL.
	Not done in Makefile.PL because ExtUtils::MakeMaker
	does not seem to like it.
    Include t/celestrak_datasets.t, t/executable.t,
	t/iridium_status.t, t/manifest.t, and
	t/spacetrack_datasets.t in distribution, but only run
	them if environment variable DEVELOPER_TEST is true.
    Move changes from Astro::SpaceTrack pod to Changes file.
    t/basic.t will now display net errors where generated and
	(hopefully) appropriate.

0.036 31-Dec-2008 T. R. Wyant
    Revise Celestrak retrieval status check to get (hopefully) a
	better indication of what happened when retrieval failed.
    Add dependency on Params::Util 0.012; use _INSTANCE from that
	module, rather than eval{$thing->isa($class)}.
    Use IO::File rather than FileHandle to open files.
    Include t/critic.t (Test::Perl::Critic) and t/perlcriticrc
	in distribution, but only test if environment variable
	DEVELOPER_TEST is true.
    Remove '## no critic' flags in code, which are not needed at
	the desired severity (--stern) if run with the distributed
	t/perlcriticrc file.
