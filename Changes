    Validate search options -exclude and -status even if they come in
	through the API in a hash, not just if they come in as
	command-line-style arguments.

    Update copy of GNU GPL in LICENSES/Copying to have current FSF

    Require Test::More 0.88 for testing.
    Remove the Space Shuttle option from the SpaceTrackTk 'Human Space
        Flight' dialog.

0.054		21-Jul-2011	T. R. Wyant
    With the end of the U.S. Space Shuttle program, deprecate the
        celestrak() 'sts' catalog and the spaceflight() 'SHUTTLE'
	argument. The latter now does nothing, so we will not get 404
	errors when the web page goes away.

0.053		04-Jul-2011	T. R. Wyant
    Correct the URL for Mike McCants' Iridium status web page.

0.052		12-Apr-2011	T. R. Wyant
    Add attribute scheme_space_track_attribute, defaulting to 'https'.
	Also added LWP::Protocol::https as a dependency. Both in
	response to USSTRATCOM going to a secure server some time in the
	last 24 hours. Thanks to Thomas Wehr for diagnosing this, and
	reporting both problem and solution.

0.051		10-Feb-2011	T. R. Wyant
    Correct check for non-existent attribute in Astro::SpaceTrack getv()
	method.
    Update documentation of Mike McCants' status codes.

0.050		12-Oct-2010	T. R. Wyant
    Remove the diagnostics inserted in 0.049_01.

0.049_01	02-Oct-2010	T. R. Wyant
    _Really_ properly default the 'sort' retrieve option. Honest.
    More voluminous diagnostics in t/query.t for spacetrack() CPAN
        testers failures in 0.049.

0.049		26-Sep-2010	T. R. Wyant
    Properly default the 'sort' retrieve option when options are
	specified as a hash reference rather than as command-style
	options.

0.048		18-Sep-2010	T. R. Wyant
    Correct skip counts in t/query.t. Add xt/author/query_skip_sites.t
        to try to ensure they don't get out of whack again.

0.047		17-Sep-2010	T. R. Wyant
    Add Astro::SpaceTrack method getv() to do what get() should have
	done -- return the attribute value without wrapping it in an
	HTTP::Response object.
    Add the -rcs option to the Astro::SpaceTrack search_*() methods, to
	request that the radar cross-section data be hacked into the
	name line of the TLE, in the same way that the effective date is
	for Human Space Flight TLEs.
    Complete rewrite of SpaceTrackTk, to incorporate all (or at least
	the great majority) of the modern bells and whistles.
    Update banner text to try to make clear that only Space Track
	requires registration before use.
    Update documentation to show all content_types.
    Drop requirement for Params::Util.
    Require Perl 5.6.2, since that is the earliest version I have  a
	prayer of actually supporting.
    Move author tests from xt/ to xt/author.

0.046		28-Mar-2010	T. R. Wyant
    Add methods search_decay(), search_oid(), and box_score().
    Replace '' with undef in the array returned by the search_* methods
	in list context. The HTTP::Response returned by these methods
	is unchanged.

0.045_01	22-Mar-2010	T. R. Wyant
    Add -notle option to the search_* methods. This causes them to
        return the results of the search, rather than going on to
	retrieve the TLEs. The results are one entry per line with
	fields tab-delimited, and whitespace compressed and trimmed
	front and back. No change in the list returned in list context,
	except for the whitespace massaging.

0.045		01-Mar-2010	T. R. Wyant
    Redo README to be more like the CPAN-recommended organization and
        contents.

0.044_01	22-Feb-2010	T. R. Wyant
    Move developer tests to xt/, and run them with Build target
        authortest, supplied by inc/My/Module/Build.pm. The author tests
        are not supported with make.
    Split off the data acquisition tests from t/basic.t into t/query.t.
        Both these, plus xt/celestrak_datasets.t and xt/executable.t
        were rewritten to use Test::More 0.40, which is now required for
        building (or at least testing!) the package.
    Make some of the tests in t/query.t TODO, since they require
        historical data, and Space Track seems to have had a database
        problem.
    Convert all code to the CPAN-recommended license scheme. Update all
        copyrights while I was at it.
    Make the version of all production code in the package (including
        Astro::SpaceTrack::Parser, which was previously unversioned) to
        be the same as the package itself.
    Update the counts for the various debris events that are documented
        in Astro::SpaceTrack.

    Get rid of YAML dump in Build.PL, that was carelessly left in
        after I convinced Module::Build not to insert itself as
        required for configuration (because I also distribute
        Makefile.PL

0.043		01-Sep-2009	T. R. Wyant
    Add the retrieve() options to search_id(), which never had them
	before.
    Test the request arguments generated for each of the Space Track
	methods, to try to make sure we do not lose them again.

0.042		30-Aug-2009	T. R. Wyant
    Add the retrieve() options back to Space Track search requests.
	These were lost in version 0.035 when Perl::Critic compliance
	was added. Thanks to Thomas Wehr for finding this.

0.041		18-Aug-2009	T. R. Wyant
    Add ability to parse effective date from NASA Human Spaceflight.
        Add this to line 0 of the NASA TLE as --effective date_text.
        This is optional, and done only if '-effective' is passed
	to the spaceflight() method. The reason this was done was to
	support the 'effective' attribute of Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE.
	Thanks to Thomas Wehr for reporting the problem this addresses,
	and T. S. Kelso for explaining what was needed to fix it.

0.040		22-Apr-2009	T. R. Wyant
    Suppress undefined value warnings generated when username and
	password are set via 'set' rather than via the relevant
	environment variables when the object is instantiated.

    Document Celestrak 'direct-fetch-only' data sets
	'cosmos-2251-debris' and 'iridium-33-debris'.
    Fix 'spaceflight' retrieval test, which failed if all NASA's
	orbital elements had epochs in the future.

0.038		13-Feb-2009	T. R. Wyant
    Correct parsing of Rod Sladen's Iridium status web page to

    Correct '## no critic' entries to put parens around names of
	policies to be disabled.
    Update t/perlcriticrc.

0.037		01-Jan-2009	T. R. Wyant
    Retract copyright year test in t/basic.t
    Update version and copyright in Astro::SpaceTrack. No other
	changes.

0.036		31-Dec-2008	T. R. Wyant
    Revise Celestrak retrieval status check to get (hopefully) a
	better indication of what happened when retrieval failed.
    Add dependency on Params::Util 0.012; use _INSTANCE from that
	module, rather than eval{$thing->isa($class)}.
    Use IO::File rather than FileHandle to open files.
    Include t/critic.t (Test::Perl::Critic) and t/perlcriticrc
	in distribution, but only test if environment variable
	DEVELOPER_TEST is true.
    Remove '## no critic' flags in code, which are not needed at
	the desired severity (--stern) if run with the distributed
	t/perlcriticrc file.

0.035		23-Dec-2008	T. R. Wyant
    When using Rod Sladen's data for Iridium status, mark all
	'failed' iridiums as tumbling, whether or not there is
	a 't' next to their numbers. This makes the Sladen data
	consistent with Mike McCants' (as of 22-Dec-2008) and
	T. S. Kelso's.
    Bring all code up to perlcritic --stern (sometimes by
	declaring exceptions)
    Restructure Build.PL and Makefile.PL to better accomodate
	the installed version of Module::Build or
	ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
    Add minimum Perl version to 'requires' key in Build.PL.
	Not done in Makefile.PL because ExtUtils::MakeMaker
	does not seem to like it.
    Include t/celestrak_datasets.t, t/executable.t,
	t/iridium_status.t, t/manifest.t, and
	t/spacetrack_datasets.t in distribution, but only run
	them if environment variable DEVELOPER_TEST is true.
    Move changes from Astro::SpaceTrack pod to Changes file.
    t/basic.t will now display net errors where generated and
	(hopefully) appropriate.

0.034		24-Nov-2008	T. R. Wyant
    Eliminate use of UNIVERSAL::isa as a function.
    Add 'Pragma spacetrack-source = ' header to all methods
	that return TLEs or Iridium status, saying where
	the data came from.
    Add content_source() method to access spacetrack-source
	header.
    Try for less bad test coverage. Good coverage awaits a
	rewrite of the shell() method.

0.033		30-Sep-2008	T. R. Wyant
    Fix Build.PL -y (and -n)
    Add iridium_status('sladen') to scrape Rod Sladen's Iridium

    Add attribute 'url_iridium_status_sladen'.

0.032		06-Jul-2008	T. R. Wyant
    More graceful failure when unable to parse Space Track data.

0.031		21-Dec-2007	T. R. Wyant
    Fix embedded modifier bug, exposed by the fixing of the
	corresponding Perl bug (id=22354) in 5.10.0 -- or 5.9.0
	actually. Thanks to Andy Lester's article:
	http://perlbuzz.com/mechanix/2007/12/code-broken-by-regex-fixes-in.html
	which tipped me off before I had to discover the problem
	for myself.
    Fixed dependencies in Makefile.PL and Build.PL.
    Went back to prompting for executables in Makefile.PL and
	Build.PL, as a way to handle apparant ActiveState build
	failure because both they and I were running pl2bat.bat.
    Enhance ExtUtils::MakeMaker version detection in Makefile.PL,
	since ActiveState is apparantly deploying a Perl 5.10
	with a development version of that module.

0.030		24-Oct-2007	T. R. Wyant
    Add Celestrak 'sts' data set name to catalog.

    Add Celestrak galileo and sbas data set names to catalog.
    Document celestrak data set names, or at least how to get them and
	in general how they are formed.
    Trap and error out on invalid spacetrack() data set numbers.
    Add data set numbers to spacetrack() help.
    Document how to get the current spacetrack data set names and
	numbers, and what happens if they renumber.
    Trap case where 'get' is called without an argument.
    Have 'shell' method interpret 'show' as 'get', and special-case
	'get' without arguments to display all attributes. Document
	this.

0.028		15-May-2007	T. R. Wyant
   Interpret missing spacetrack() catalog as a failure,
     even though the request succeeds.
   Ditto missing Space Track retrieve() data.
   Add 'fallback' attribute to cause celestrak() to fall
     back to using Celestrak data if Space Track data
     are not available.
   Clear session cookie when username or password change.

0.027		30-Jan-2007	T. R. Wyant

0.026		06-Nov-2006	T. R. Wyant
   New location for Mike McCants' Iridium status page.

   Have spaceflight() return NO_RECORDS on failure, not
     NO_CAT_ID.
   Have attribute_names() return list ref in scalar context.
   Add attribute iridium_status_format; have iridium_status()
     use this to decide who to access and what format to
     return, including support for the new Celestrak status
     information.
   Have iridium_status() return parsed data with 'portable'
     status if called in list context.
