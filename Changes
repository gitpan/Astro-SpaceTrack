  Expose the name of the Space Track session cookie as an attribute.
    This is one of those attributes which have distinct values for each
    value of space_track_version.
  Have the parser for the retrieve() -start_epoch and -end_epoch options
    accept time of day as well as just date. Pass time of day to the
    server when using the Space Track REST interface.

0.060_07	2012-07-21	T. R. Wyant
  Further deprecate celestrak( 'sts' ) and spaceflight( 'shuttle' ) so
    that they give a warning every time they are used. I jumped the gun
    a bit, but this is a development release.
  If both -json and -rcs are in effect, return RCSSOURCE as well as
    RCSVALUE.
  Have the attribute_names() method take account of the fact that the
    'cookie_expires' attribute does not exist if the space_track_version
    attribute is set to 2.
  Ignore the -sort and -descending retrieve() options when using the
    Space Track REST interface. As things now stand, I have to force the
    equivalent of -sort=epoch -descending when retrieve()-ing multiple
    OIDs to get sane results.
  Add a -json retrieve() option, valid only if the REST interface is in
    use. This also works with celestrak() and file() if the
    space_track_version attribute is 2, but with celestrak() the usual
    restrictions on retrieve() options apply.
  Retrieve TLEs for multiple OIDs in a single call to the Space Track
    REST interface.

0.060_06	2012-07-12	T. R. Wyant
  Require HTTP::Status 6.03, because I can't forebear to use the
    "teapot" status for testing purposes.

0.060_05	2012-07-11	T. R. Wyant
  Expose spacetrack_query_v2(), which is our lowest-level interface to
    Space Track version 2.
  Use JSON rather than YAML for serialization in (e.g.)
    t/spacetrack_request.t, since the former is now a requirement, but
    the latter never was.
  Bit-mapped the unsupported dump_headers attribute.
  Eliminated the unsupported debug_url attribute.

0.060_04	2012-07-06	T. R. Wyant
  Implement epoch selection of TLEs via the Space Track REST interface.
  Run all the Space Track REST arguments through URI::Escape, which has
    been added as a requirement.
  Try to detect Space Track login failure due to a host verification
    problem, and recommend setting the verify_hostname attribute false.

0.060_03	2012-07-02	T. R. Wyant
  Correct erroneous skip() outside SKIP: block in t/query.t.

0.060_02	2012-07-02	T. R. Wyant
  Add JSON as dependency. It's used by the Space Track V2 interface.

0.060_01	2012-07-01	T. R. Wyant
  Provide access to Space Track v2 REST interface, which is currently in
    beta. This involves adding attribute space_track_version. Attributes
    cookie_expires, domain_space_track, and session_cookie now have
    separate values for each possible value of space_track_version.
    Due to limitations of the version 2 interface, bulk data downloads
    throw an exception, and the with_name attribute is ignored by
    retrieve(),
  Add a logout() method, which deletes all the session cookies. I
    considered having it only delete the session cookie for the current
    space_track_version, but decided that this was too confusing.
  Fix problem with Astro::SpaceTrack file() method passing its options
    hash to the retrieve() method as an OID. This was probably
    introduced in version 0.020.
  Bump Test::More requirement from 0.88 to 0.96 so I can do subtests.
  Add method content_interface, which returns the version of the Space
    Track interface use to fetch the data. If Space Track was not
    involved, returns undef.
  Add verify_hostname option to SpaceTrackTk settings window. Add
    'Settings ...' button to login screen.

0.060		2012-06-09	T. R. Wyant
  Add Astro::SpaceTrack attribute verify_hostname. This controls the
    corresponding SSL option for LWP::UserAgent. By default it is true,
    but can be made false to deal with invalid (or at least
    unrecognized) certificates,

0.059		2012-06-02	T. R. Wyant
  Get rid of YAML::Any in favor of YAML. They are both in the same
    distro, and YAML does not suffer from deprecation warnings.

0.058		2012-02-22	T. R. Wyant
  Use GET rather than POST to implement Astro::SpaceTrack box_score(),
    since 'POST' gives undefined errors during testing. Sometimes.

0.057		2012-01-22	T. R. Wyant
  Further deprecate the Astro::SpaceTrack celestrak( 'sts' ) and
    spaceflight( 'shuttle' ) functionality by having them display a
    warning on first use. The next step (warning on every use) will be
    taken on or after July 22 2012.
  Expand ranges passed to the search_oid() method, since the Space Track
    API does not support them.
  Bring Changes file into compliance with Test::CPAN::Changes. Add
    author test xt/author/changes.t to be sure it remains so.

0.056		2011-12-18	T. R. Wyant
    Validate search options -exclude and -status even if they come in
	through the API in a hash, not just if they come in as
	command-line-style arguments.

0.055		2011-11-28	T. R. Wyant
    Update copy of GNU GPL in LICENSES/Copying to have current FSF
        address.
    Require Test::More 0.88 for testing.
    Remove the Space Shuttle option from the SpaceTrackTk 'Human Space
        Flight' dialog.

0.054		2011-07-21	T. R. Wyant
    With the end of the U.S. Space Shuttle program, deprecate the
        celestrak() 'sts' catalog and the spaceflight() 'SHUTTLE'
	argument. The latter now does nothing, so we will not get 404
	errors when the web page goes away.

0.053		2011-07-04	T. R. Wyant
    Correct the URL for Mike McCants' Iridium status web page.

0.052		2011-04-12	T. R. Wyant
    Add attribute scheme_space_track_attribute, defaulting to 'https'.
	Also added LWP::Protocol::https as a dependency. Both in
	response to USSTRATCOM going to a secure server some time in the
	last 24 hours. Thanks to Thomas Wehr for diagnosing this, and
	reporting both problem and solution.

0.051		2011-02-10	T. R. Wyant
    Correct check for non-existent attribute in Astro::SpaceTrack getv()
	method.
    Update documentation of Mike McCants' status codes.

0.050		2010-10-12	T. R. Wyant
    Remove the diagnostics inserted in 0.049_01.

0.049_01	2010-10-02	T. R. Wyant
    _Really_ properly default the 'sort' retrieve option. Honest.
    More voluminous diagnostics in t/query.t for spacetrack() CPAN
        testers failures in 0.049.

0.049		2010-09-26	T. R. Wyant
    Properly default the 'sort' retrieve option when options are
	specified as a hash reference rather than as command-style
	options.

0.048		2010-09-18	T. R. Wyant
    Correct skip counts in t/query.t. Add xt/author/query_skip_sites.t
        to try to ensure they don't get out of whack again.

0.047		2010-09-17	T. R. Wyant
    Add Astro::SpaceTrack method getv() to do what get() should have
	done -- return the attribute value without wrapping it in an
	HTTP::Response object.
    Add the -rcs option to the Astro::SpaceTrack search_*() methods, to
	request that the radar cross-section data be hacked into the
	name line of the TLE, in the same way that the effective date is
	for Human Space Flight TLEs.
    Complete rewrite of SpaceTrackTk, to incorporate all (or at least
	the great majority) of the modern bells and whistles.
    Update banner text to try to make clear that only Space Track
	requires registration before use.
    Update documentation to show all content_types.
    Drop requirement for Params::Util.
    Require Perl 5.6.2, since that is the earliest version I have  a
	prayer of actually supporting.
    Move author tests from xt/ to xt/author.

0.046		2010-03-28	T. R. Wyant
    Add methods search_decay(), search_oid(), and box_score().
    Replace '' with undef in the array returned by the search_* methods
	in list context. The HTTP::Response returned by these methods
	is unchanged.

0.045_01	2010-03-22	T. R. Wyant
    Add -notle option to the search_* methods. This causes them to
        return the results of the search, rather than going on to
	retrieve the TLEs. The results are one entry per line with
	fields tab-delimited, and whitespace compressed and trimmed
	front and back. No change in the list returned in list context,
	except for the whitespace massaging.

0.045		2010-03-01	T. R. Wyant
    Redo README to be more like the CPAN-recommended organization and
        contents.

0.044_01	2010-02-22	T. R. Wyant
    Move developer tests to xt/, and run them with Build target
        authortest, supplied by inc/My/Module/Build.pm. The author tests
        are not supported with make.
    Split off the data acquisition tests from t/basic.t into t/query.t.
        Both these, plus xt/celestrak_datasets.t and xt/executable.t
        were rewritten to use Test::More 0.40, which is now required for
        building (or at least testing!) the package.
    Make some of the tests in t/query.t TODO, since they require
        historical data, and Space Track seems to have had a database
        problem.
    Convert all code to the CPAN-recommended license scheme. Update all
        copyrights while I was at it.
    Make the version of all production code in the package (including
        Astro::SpaceTrack::Parser, which was previously unversioned) to
        be the same as the package itself.
    Update the counts for the various debris events that are documented
        in Astro::SpaceTrack.

0.044		2009-09-03	T. R. Wyant
    Get rid of YAML dump in Build.PL, that was carelessly left in
        after I convinced Module::Build not to insert itself as
        required for configuration (because I also distribute
        Makefile.PL

0.043		2009-09-01	T. R. Wyant
    Add the retrieve() options to search_id(), which never had them
	before.
    Test the request arguments generated for each of the Space Track
	methods, to try to make sure we do not lose them again.

0.042		2009-08-30	T. R. Wyant
    Add the retrieve() options back to Space Track search requests.
	These were lost in version 0.035 when Perl::Critic compliance
	was added. Thanks to Thomas Wehr for finding this.

0.041		2009-08-18	T. R. Wyant
    Add ability to parse effective date from NASA Human Spaceflight.
        Add this to line 0 of the NASA TLE as --effective date_text.
        This is optional, and done only if '-effective' is passed
	to the spaceflight() method. The reason this was done was to
	support the 'effective' attribute of Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE.
	Thanks to Thomas Wehr for reporting the problem this addresses,
	and T. S. Kelso for explaining what was needed to fix it.

0.040		2009-04-22	T. R. Wyant
    Suppress undefined value warnings generated when username and

    Document Celestrak 'direct-fetch-only' data sets
	'cosmos-2251-debris' and 'iridium-33-debris'.
    Fix 'spaceflight' retrieval test, which failed if all NASA's
	orbital elements had epochs in the future.

0.038		2009-02-13	T. R. Wyant
    Correct parsing of Rod Sladen's Iridium status web page to

    Update t/perlcriticrc.

0.037		2009-01-01	T. R. Wyant
    Retract copyright year test in t/basic.t
    Update version and copyright in Astro::SpaceTrack. No other
	changes.

0.036		2008-12-31	T. R. Wyant
    Revise Celestrak retrieval status check to get (hopefully) a
	better indication of what happened when retrieval failed.
    Add dependency on Params::Util 0.012; use _INSTANCE from that
	module, rather than eval{$thing->isa($class)}.
    Use IO::File rather than FileHandle to open files.
    Include t/critic.t (Test::Perl::Critic) and t/perlcriticrc
	in distribution, but only test if environment variable
	DEVELOPER_TEST is true.
    Remove '## no critic' flags in code, which are not needed at
	the desired severity (--stern) if run with the distributed
	t/perlcriticrc file.

0.035		2008-12-23	T. R. Wyant
    When using Rod Sladen's data for Iridium status, mark all
	'failed' iridiums as tumbling, whether or not there is
	a 't' next to their numbers. This makes the Sladen data
	consistent with Mike McCants' (as of 22-Dec-2008) and
	T. S. Kelso's.
    Bring all code up to perlcritic --stern (sometimes by
	declaring exceptions)
    Restructure Build.PL and Makefile.PL to better accomodate
	the installed version of Module::Build or
	ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
    Add minimum Perl version to 'requires' key in Build.PL.
	Not done in Makefile.PL because ExtUtils::MakeMaker
	does not seem to like it.
    Include t/celestrak_datasets.t, t/executable.t,
	t/iridium_status.t, t/manifest.t, and
	t/spacetrack_datasets.t in distribution, but only run
	them if environment variable DEVELOPER_TEST is true.
    Move changes from Astro::SpaceTrack pod to Changes file.
    t/basic.t will now display net errors where generated and
	(hopefully) appropriate.

0.034		2008-11-24	T. R. Wyant
    Eliminate use of UNIVERSAL::isa as a function.
    Add 'Pragma spacetrack-source = ' header to all methods
	that return TLEs or Iridium status, saying where
	the data came from.
    Add content_source() method to access spacetrack-source
	header.
    Try for less bad test coverage. Good coverage awaits a
	rewrite of the shell() method.

0.033		2008-09-30	T. R. Wyant
    Fix Build.PL -y (and -n)
    Add iridium_status('sladen') to scrape Rod Sladen's Iridium

0.031		2007-12-21	T. R. Wyant
    Fix embedded modifier bug, exposed by the fixing of the
	corresponding Perl bug (id=22354) in 5.10.0 -- or 5.9.0
	actually. Thanks to Andy Lester's article:
	http://perlbuzz.com/mechanix/2007/12/code-broken-by-regex-fixes-in.html
	which tipped me off before I had to discover the problem
	for myself.
    Fixed dependencies in Makefile.PL and Build.PL.
    Went back to prompting for executables in Makefile.PL and
	Build.PL, as a way to handle apparant ActiveState build
	failure because both they and I were running pl2bat.bat.
    Enhance ExtUtils::MakeMaker version detection in Makefile.PL,
	since ActiveState is apparantly deploying a Perl 5.10
	with a development version of that module.

0.030		2007-10-24	T. R. Wyant

    Add Celestrak galileo and sbas data set names to catalog.
    Document celestrak data set names, or at least how to get them and
	in general how they are formed.
    Trap and error out on invalid spacetrack() data set numbers.
    Add data set numbers to spacetrack() help.
    Document how to get the current spacetrack data set names and
	numbers, and what happens if they renumber.
    Trap case where 'get' is called without an argument.
    Have 'shell' method interpret 'show' as 'get', and special-case
	'get' without arguments to display all attributes. Document
	this.

0.028		2007-05-15	T. R. Wyant
   Interpret missing spacetrack() catalog as a failure,
     even though the request succeeds.
   Ditto missing Space Track retrieve() data.
   Add 'fallback' attribute to cause celestrak() to fall
     back to using Celestrak data if Space Track data
     are not available.
   Clear session cookie when username or password change.

0.027		2007-01-30	T. R. Wyant
   Add ability to search by on-orbit status ('onorbit',

   Tweak docs.
   Update copyright.

0.026		2006-11-06	T. R. Wyant
   New location for Mike McCants' Iridium status page.

   Have spaceflight() return NO_RECORDS on failure, not
     NO_CAT_ID.
   Have attribute_names() return list ref in scalar context.
   Add attribute iridium_status_format; have iridium_status()
     use this to decide who to access and what format to
     return, including support for the new Celestrak status
     information.
   Have iridium_status() return parsed data with 'portable'
     status if called in list context.
