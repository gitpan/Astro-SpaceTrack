=head1 NAME

My::Module::Meta - Information needed to build Astro::SpaceTrack

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use lib qw{ inc };
 use My::Module::Meta;
 my $meta = My::Module::Meta->new();
 use JSON;
 print "Required modules:\n", to_json(
     $meta->requires(), { pretty => 1 } );

=head1 DETAILS

This module centralizes information needed to build C<App::Satpass2>. It
is private to the C<App::Satpass2> package, and may be changed or
retracted without notice.

=head1 METHODS

This class supports the following public methods:

=head2 new

 use lib qw{ inc };
 my $meta = My::Module::Meta->new();

This method instantiates the class.

=head2 build_requires

 use JSON;
 print to_json( $meta->build_requires(), { pretty => 1 } );

This method computes and returns a reference to a hash describing the
modules required to build the C<Astro::Coord::ECI> package, suitable for
use in a F<Build.PL> C<build_requires> key, or a F<Makefile.PL>
C<< {META_MERGE}->{build_requires} >> key.

=head2 distribution

 if ( $meta->distribution() ) {
     print "Making distribution\n";
 } else {
     print "Not making distribution\n";
 }

This method returns the value of the environment variable
C<MAKING_MODULE_DISTRIBUTION> at the time the object was instantiated.

=head2 notice

 my @exes = $meta->notice( \%opt, \&prompter );

This method prints a notice before building. It returns a list of
executables to build.

The arguments are the options hash returned by the build system, and a
reference to a prompt routine. This reference is given the prompt and
the default answer, and the correct argument depends on your build
system; for ExtUtils::MakeMaker it is C<\&prompt>; for Module::Build it
needs to be C<< sub { return $bldr->prompt( @_ ) } >>, where C<$bldr> is
the Module::Build object.

The above are general remarks.

In this incarnation, the method determines which executables are to be
installed.

=head2 requires

 use JSON;
 print to_json( $meta->requires(), { pretty => 1 } );

This method computes and returns a reference to a hash describing
the modules required to run the C<App::Satpass2> package, suitable for
use in a F<Build.PL> C<requires> key, or a F<Makefile.PL> C<PREREQ_PM>
key. Any additional arguments will be appended to the generated hash. In
addition, unless L<distribution()|/distribution> is true,
configuration-specific modules may be added.

=head2 requires_perl

 print 'This package requires Perl ', $meta->requires_perl(), "\n";

This method returns the version of Perl required by the package.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This class has no public attributes.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 MAKING_MODULE_DISTRIBUTION

This environment variable should be set to a true value if you are
making a distribution. This ensures that no configuration-specific
information makes it into F<META.yml>.
